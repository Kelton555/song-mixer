This is not made user friendly, a working experience with either Python or another programming language is highly recommended for getting it to work properly. Any questions or issues can be opened as issues, any contributions can be opened as pull requests.

If you use this to make a thing, it'd be nice if you credited back to this GitHub in the description/bio/whatever, but I probably won't hunt you down if you don't. Probably.
