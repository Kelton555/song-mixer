Timings included in the data.txt file are based on the audio taken directly from [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nRAj82ywkJ_YHiRh-sXKAbpiCiUfSx0-k) playlist.

This is not made user friendly, a working experience with either Python or another programming language is highly recommended for getting it to work properly. Any questions or issues can be opened as issues, any contributions can be opened as pull requests.

If you use this to make a thing, it'd be nice if you credited back to this GitHub in the description/bio/whatever, but I probably won't hunt you down if you don't. Probably.

Find video timestamps in [timestamps.md](timestamps.md)

A word of warning if you choose to run the exact same data I used for creating the video, you should have at least 200GB of space available to temporarily hold everything while you're manually converting and merging it. By the end, the final file was around 70GB, but intermediate files necessitate significantly more than that, especially if you didn't delete them between each step.
