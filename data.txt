# This is a data file for use with my python script to interweave songs/audioclips/whatever you repurpose this thing to do.
# You can find the full thing on github here: https://github.com/Kelton555/song-mixer/
# This will serve as the tutorial file rather than making an independent README to refer back to.
#
# Lines can be commented out by either putting nothing on them or starting them with any of the following characters:
# 					# * / \
# With multiple comment declarations to choose from, it might be worth creating a scheme to separate different types of comments by their declaration. Or just type a comments purpose out in words before the comment, whatever works for you.
#
# Lines will also be interpreted as comments if they start with a Space or a Tab.
#
# You can use a dash (-) to make the program print a line to console as it passes it in parsing, this can be useful as a list of 'TODO's when you outline cuts before timing them or just for other reminders for yourself at runtime.
# 
# Each song/audioclip/etc starts with a single line that declares its internal name. The line must start with a '[' and end with a ']', and the internal name will be the string contained within the square brackets.
# Do not name a song with a ':' in the name, that will go very poorly. ':'s are used to separate arguments on the same line internally, so do not use them for anything other than separating arguments or you will not have a fun time.
#
# The next non-comment line after the internal name declaration is the filepath and filetype, separated by a ':'. For example:
# 'audios/1.m4a:m4a' means the file '1.m4a' in the folder named 'audios' within the relative directory. After the colon, the filetype is listed, in this case 'm4a'.
#
# All other non-comment lines after one internal name declaration and before the next will try to be interpreted as cutaway points in the following format (with square brackets being optional):
# msToCutFrom:thingToCutTo:msToCutBackAt[:msToCutIntoThing]
#
# So, for example, we have 2 internal things, 'Song1' and 'Song2'. We want to cut to Song2 from Song1 3.5 seconds in, and then cut back to 4.5 seconds into Song1 when Song2 finishes playing. To do that, we would do the following
# Please note that all times will be in ms, make sure to convert to ms.
# Times are also relative to the full length of the song in which they refer to. 3500 ms into the same song will always be the same place no matter what has happened before hand.
#
##
## [Song1]
## songs/song1.mp3:mp3
## 3500:Song2:4500
##
## [Song2]
## songs/song2.wav:wav
##
#
# If you wanted to cut midway into Song2 at the cutaway, you could add an additional argument to the cutaway in Song1 so that it read
## 3500:Song2:4500:5500
# This means to cut 5500 ms (5.5 seconds) into Song2 when cutting away from Song1. The only thing this changes is that Song2 will start playing from 5.5 seconds in.
#
# Currently, there is only support for trimming off time from the start of a song that you cut to. Every song will have to play out from the time at which it was started until the end of the audio file.
# Currently, it will play every included audio clip in the order it was declared internally.
# Recursion is automatically avoided by preventing any song from appearing in the 'currently playing tree' twice. It *should* always terminate (unless you did something weird like making the end of a cutaway before the start of it but don't do something like that that sounds like a bad idea)
